          <p class="body-md section-text">
              Throughout my sports journey, I've been deeply immersed in both basketball and soccer, showcasing my athleticism and 
              dedication on the court and the field. Starting with AAU basketball, I honed my skills as a shooting guard over two 
              years from 2019 to 2021, where I learned the nuances of the game and the importance of teamwork. As a shooting guard, 
              my ability to hit three-pointers became a defining aspect of my playstyle. I spent countless hours perfecting my shot, 
              refining my technique, and studying the game to become a reliable threat from beyond the arc. This dedication paid off 
              as I consistently delivered clutch performances, sinking crucial three-pointers to shift momentum and secure victories 
              for my team. <br><br>
              Prior to my venture into AAU basketball, I was deeply involved in soccer, playing for a rep team before 
              relocating to Canada in 2019. Although my focus shifted to basketball upon moving, my experiences in soccer instilled 
              in me valuable lessons about discipline, strategy, and perseverance, which I seamlessly translated into my basketball 
              journey. The transition between sports was smooth, thanks to the transferable skills and mental fortitude I developed 
              on the soccer field. Now, as a member of the Senior Basketball team for my school, I continue to excel as a shooting 
              guard, utilizing my sharpshooting abilities to make a significant impact on the court. Whether it's draining 
              three-pointers in critical moments or spacing the floor to create opportunities for my teammates, I take pride in my 
              role as a reliable scorer and a threat from long range.<br><br>
              My understanding of the game's dynamics, coupled with my 
              relentless work ethic, allows me to consistently deliver strong performances and contribute to the team's success. As a 
              three-point shooter, I possess not only the technical proficiency to knock down shots from beyond the arc but also the 
              mental resilience to thrive under pressure. I embrace the responsibility that comes with being a sharpshooter, always 
              striving to elevate my game and deliver when it matters most. My journey through AAU basketball, rep soccer, and now 
              Senior Basketball has shaped me into a well-rounded athlete, instilling in me values of teamwork, dedication, and 
              determination that extend far beyond the confines of the court.<br> <br>
